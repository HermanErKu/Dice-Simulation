# Dice-Simulation
Throws A Dice and sees how many times there is a 1 or a 6.

This is a simulation i made for a school math question.

The question was:
If you throw a dice 100 times, will the number you get 1 and the number you get 6 be the same?

At first I answered; Yes, it would be the same.

I didn't think about the question for a bit, before I started to think about it.
I needed to solve it.

So i made a new python project and started.

I used almost 15 minutes to make and comment everything so that i could include it in my answer. 
What i found out, was that in only 6,7% of the times, the times that you got 6 was the same as the times you got 1.
